# NOTE: SCC includes summary categories like "Urban Local: Total" that duplicate
# data in categories like "Urban Local: Brake Wear". The trouble is we can't 
# just eliminate totals or individual entries since some years only have total, 
# and others only have entries. If at least the city is self-consistent with how
# and when they include "Total" entries, the trend lines will be in the right
# direction, but skewed/exaggerated.
